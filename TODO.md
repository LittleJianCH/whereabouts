# query

`Runner` output one by one -- for using `debug` in command line

[maybe] `query <query_pattern> debug` -- provide step in command line and web

- [maybe] inject `SolverInterrupter` to `Solver` -- from `Loader`

`query <query_pattern> fuel <number> | infinite` -- the number of steps

- [maybe] default to a finite number

`query <query_pattern> return object`

`query <query_pattern> return count`
